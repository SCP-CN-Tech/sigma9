## Sigma-9

This is a fork for the repository for the Sigma-9 theme, the default CSS used to style the [SCP Wiki](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com). It was originally created by [Aelanna](http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aelanna) and is presently maintained by the SCP Wiki Technical Team. This fork is modified by the SCP CN Wiki Technical Team to fit the [SCP-CN Wiki](http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com).

This theme is available under the wiki's [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license (CC-BY-SA)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).

### Updating the Theme

When new changes are pushed to the repository, they are not automatically reflected in the mainsite. You must open the page [`component:theme`](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/component:theme), and copy the CSS from `sigma9.css` into the `[[code]]` block.

Contrary to legend, it is not necessary to "re-select" the CSS source in the wiki's administrative panel. Updating the code block is sufficient.
